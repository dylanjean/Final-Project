# Final-Project

In this capstone project, my team and I utilized all of the skills we learned throughout our six month bootcamp. We created a machine learning project using Tensorflow, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks. We then created a Flask application that can run locally and predict future Bitcoin prices as well as provide visualizations to help our users learn more about cryptocurrency.
